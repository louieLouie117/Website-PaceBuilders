                            <p>Pace Builders, Inc. is here to take your remodeling or new construction project, from
                                just a vision into reality. While we work closely with the architect and designers,
                                however as the client, you, can take on the designer/ project manager role, especially
                                if you have a complete vision for the project. We understand the construction project is
                                your vision and our goal it to help you to create what you desire. Pace Builders strives
                                to provide every client with exceptional work, as well as create the space that you had
                                dreamed of.</p>
                            <h5>Process</h5>
                            <p>Pace Builders believes in helping clients through the intimidating process of designing,
                                permitting, zoning, and budgeting the construction project is a priority. We strive to
                                create cost transparency though out the project. The invoice provided for each project
                                includes information about the numbers of employees on the job, their work logs, and a
                                clear copy of all materials used on the project. This insure the client has the complete
                                breakdown of the project’s cost.</p>
                            <h5>Time and Materials VS Fixed Cost</h5>

                            <p>Contractors often give quotes for their services based on a fixed-cost basis. For a
                                contractor, this means the client carries all risk. If a contractor underestimates
                                the quote, there are ways to cut materials and/or labor costs that would be
                                invisible to the client. If a contractor overestimates they have no obligation to
                                any pass savings on to you. No one wants a contractor to pocket a bonus at your
                                expense..</p>

                            <p>Pace Builders, Inc. is here to take your remodeling or new construction project, from
                                just a vision into reality. While we work closely with the architect and designers,
                                however as the client, you, can take on the designer/ project manager role, especially
                                if you have a complete vision for the project. We understand the construction project is
                                your vision and our goal it to help you to create what you desire. Pace Builders strives
                                to provide every client with exceptional work, as well as create the space that you had
                                dreamed of.</p>
                            <h5>Process</h5>
                            <p>Pace Builders believes in helping clients through the intimidating process of designing,
                                permitting, zoning, and budgeting the construction project is a priority. We strive to
                                create cost transparency though out the project. The invoice provided for each project
                                includes information about the numbers of employees on the job, their work logs, and a
                                clear copy of all materials used on the project. This insure the client has the complete
                                breakdown of the project’s cost.</p>
                            <h5>Time and Materials VS Fixed Cost</h5>

                            <p>Contractors often give quotes for their services based on a fixed-cost basis. For a
                                contractor, this means the client carries all risk. If a contractor underestimates
                                the quote, there are ways to cut materials and/or labor costs that would be
                                invisible to the client. If a contractor overestimates they have no obligation to
                                any pass savings on to you. No one wants a contractor to pocket a bonus at your
                                expense..</p>

                            <h5>Services</h5>
                            <p>Pace Builders, Inc. is here to take your remodeling or new construction project, from
                                just a vision into reality. While we work closely with the architect and designers,
                                however as the client, you, can take on the designer/ project manager role, especially
                                if you have a complete vision for the project. We understand the construction project is
                                your vision and our goal it to help you to create what you desire. Pace Builders strives
                                to provide every client with exceptional work, as well as create the space that you had
                                dreamed of.</p>
                            <h5>Process</h5>
                            <p>Pace Builders believes in helping clients through the intimidating process of designing,
                                permitting, zoning, and budgeting the construction project is a priority. We strive to
                                create cost transparency though out the project. The invoice provided for each project
                                includes information about the numbers of employees on the job, their work logs, and a
                                clear copy of all materials used on the project. This insure the client has the complete
                                breakdown of the project’s cost.</p>
                            <h5>Time and Materials VS Fixed Cost</h5>

                            <p>Contractors often give quotes for their services based on a fixed-cost basis. For a
                                contractor, this means the client carries all risk. If a contractor underestimates
                                the quote, there are ways to cut materials and/or labor costs that would be
                                invisible to the client. If a contractor overestimates they have no obligation to
                                any pass savings on to you. No one wants a contractor to pocket a bonus at your
                                expense..</p>
